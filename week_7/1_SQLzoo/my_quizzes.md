### Reflection
I spent all the time I had for DBC last week on the SQL Database tutorial on teamtreehouse.com. I have to say that I learned a lot.
I had a clear understanding of what all this exercises where asking; the hard part was to remember the syntax.
Writing SQL statements or queries is fun and challenging. I have to recognize that in some points I have to research. I learned about GROUP BY, COUNT, HAVING.
I'm submitting my week 7 so I'm trying to do it fast I made some mistakes on the quizzes that where more related to not paying enough attention than technical knowledge. 
I'm really exited about learning SQL and it's something that I want to master because this will be the foundation of many products that I need to build.
Seems like possibilities are endless with SQL to the point that I would love to learn R + SQL.
