#### I worked on this challenge by myself.

## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
Here Im modeling a one to one relation. In this case I want to show an example of employees having one employer and employers having the posibiliy to have multiple employees.

In this case companies can have multiples departaments and departaments can exist in multiples companies. That's why I join both tables in one that realtes both variables, companies and departaments.

## Release 5: Reflection
This challenge was excellent. Designing schemas is completely new for me. The tool to do it is fun and easy to work with (I can think on some improvements though).
It helped me visualize the different kind of relations and I gave me a better understanding of the difference between primary, foreign and unique keys.
It was a little challenging to think about a one to one and multiple to multiple relations from scratch but I think I got it.
I see designing databases as a fundamental part on my learning process. I need to master this discipline.
