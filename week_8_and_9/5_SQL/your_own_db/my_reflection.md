##REFECTIONS  
This was a really fun challenge.  
Going through the entire process was clarifying and super helpful.  
I was not able to create a FOREIGN key from the terminal.  
I end up selecting from a using JOIN.  
I can see the potential of using SQL and RUBY because this process took me a while to run it every week using
Excel.  
I use the the generate SQL (My SQL) funtion on the Socrates SQL Disigner. Super helpful and easy to use.  
I just hope that's is not considered cheating.
