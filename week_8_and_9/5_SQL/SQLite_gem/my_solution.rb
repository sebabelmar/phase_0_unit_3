##### BONUS #######
# TODO (bonus) - Stop SQL injection attacks!  Statmaster learned that interpolation of variables in SQL statements leaves some security vulnerabilities.  Use the google to figure out how to protect from this type of attack.

# TODO (bonus)
# Create a listing of all of the Politicians and the number of votes they recieved
# output should look like:  Sen. John McCain - 7,323 votes (This is an example, yours will not return this value, it should just 
#    have a similar format)
# Create a listing of each Politician and the voter that voted for them
# output should include the senators name, then a long list of voters separated by a comma

# REFLECTION- Include your reflection as a comment below.

# How does the sqlite3 gem work?  
# The gem passes SQL statements form ruby, execute them and return results into ruby.
# Seems like it going down to terminal, execute statements on sqlie3 on it and save 
# the result to bring it to ruby.

# What is the variable `$db` holding?  
# This is a universal variable holding the data base.
  

# Take a stab at explaining the line 
# `$db.execute("SELECT name FROM congress_members WHERE years_in_congress 
#   > #{minimum_years}")`.  Try to explain this as clearly as possible for 
# your fellow students.  
# Returns one column with multiples rows of names from the table congress_members that 
# have values for the variable years in congress > a speficy number seted by a parameter 
# it will be passed on a method.
