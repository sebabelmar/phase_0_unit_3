//     DEFINE var ballot = to votes[voter]

// DEFINE a variable winner as a function that takes voteCount in as a argument
//  iterate through votecount's position
//    iterate through each candidates votes
//      put all of the votes into an array
//        find the candidate with the highest value in the array

// Reflection
I pair with Kevin and Clark on this challenge.
To be honest I was so lost the first 20 minutes. JS iteration over this "js Hashes" was completely out 
of my scope of knowledge. 
I kind of got it, and I was able to contribute on the logic of the second method that we wrote.
Even being 3 heads on this challenge we got stacked. It took us a while to find a simple syntax mistake.
But we learned a lot. Actually I learned something completely new.
Im going to need to go over this challenge rewrite it by my own a few times and run different sections of it to have a complete
visual understanding of what is going on here. Now for the abstracted comprehension of it that I have I donâ€™t feel 100% confortable.
Great challenge and it was great to see Clark and Kevin writing it.
